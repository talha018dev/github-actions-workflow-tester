          Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}

          Objectives:
          1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed
          2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues
          3) For each issue found, provide a clear solution or fix suggestion in comments ONLY
          4) NEVER automatically apply fixes or create commits - only suggest solutions for the author to review and apply
          5) Leave concise inline comments (2-3 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end

          Procedure:
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - For each issue identified:
            * Clearly describe the problem
            * ALWAYS provide a specific solution suggestion in comments (NEVER apply fixes automatically):
              - Provide code examples showing the fix
              - Include complete code snippets in markdown code blocks
              - Explain the reasoning behind the suggested fix
              - Make suggestions actionable and easy to apply
            * Format suggestions clearly:
              - Show the problematic code (if relevant)
              - Show the suggested fix in a code block
              - Explain why the fix is needed
          - IMPORTANT: DO NOT edit files, create commits, or push changes. Only comment with suggestions.
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ✅ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
          - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines

          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
          - Each comment MUST include: (1) the problem identified, (2) a specific solution or code suggestion
          - Provide actionable solutions: show code examples, suggest fixes, or recommend best practices
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement
          - Format solutions clearly: use code blocks for code suggestions, bullet points for multiple options

          Submission:
          - Submit one review containing inline comments with suggestions plus a concise summary
          - Use only: gh pr review --comment
          - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes
          - Do not create commits or push changes - only provide suggestions in comments
          - In the summary, mention how many issues were found and that suggestions are provided for review"
