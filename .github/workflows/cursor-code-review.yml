          Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}

          Objectives:
          1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed
          2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues
          3) For each issue found, provide a clear solution or fix suggestion
          4) Automatically fix issues when possible: create commits with fixes and push to the PR branch
          5) Leave concise inline comments (2-3 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end

          Procedure:
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - For each issue identified:
            * Clearly describe the problem
            * If the fix is straightforward and safe, automatically apply it:
              - Edit the file(s) directly to fix the issue
              - Create a commit with a clear message: "fix: [brief description of fix]"
              - Push the commit to the PR branch: git push origin HEAD
            * If automatic fixing is not appropriate, provide a specific solution in comments:
              - Code example, fix, or best practice recommendation
              - Include code snippets in markdown code blocks when suggesting fixes
          - When you create a fix commit, also leave a comment explaining what was fixed
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ✅ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
          - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines

          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
          - Each comment MUST include: (1) the problem identified, (2) a specific solution or code suggestion
          - Provide actionable solutions: show code examples, suggest fixes, or recommend best practices
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement
          - Format solutions clearly: use code blocks for code suggestions, bullet points for multiple options

          Submission:
          - If you made any fixes: push commits first, then submit review
          - Submit one review containing inline comments plus a concise summary
          - Use only: gh pr review --comment
          - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes
          - When fixes are applied, mention in the review summary: \"Applied automatic fixes for [X] issues\""
